# Human-Pose_Estimation


1. Problem Statement/Opportunity*:  
The problem of human pose estimation can be defined as the computer vision techniques that predict the location of various human keypoints (joints and landmarks) such as elbows, knees, neck, shoulder, hips, chest etc.

   Itâ€™s a very challenging problem due to various factors such as small and hardly visible parts, occlusions and huge variability in articulations. Benefit, is there any abnormalities in human poles so doctors can use this. You can also do action recognition so that robots can learn like what type of directions we are giving to them. So these we can track from using the human post estimation.


2. Project Description*:
human post estimation. It's a very interesting, important problem in computerizations. Imagine we were able to track different points on human body. So what we can do from that we can create a mechanical model in the computer itself.
So this we can do in real-time, also estimate or it will track the 18 different points on the human body. So, you can see like zero to one. It will show this is similar to one to two. It's neck to shoulder, left shoulder, right shoulder. Where is the right shoulder? Where it's elbow? Where's the legs? So these we can estimate from them.



3. I used, Microsoft Portal where I used Microsoft Storage services for uploading my project source code.
